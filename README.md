Fat Oak
======

Adding all this stuff to every new project is stoopid, so I boxed it up. I'm welcome.

Built with:
- Middleman
- Bower
- Haml
- Scss

Features:
- Autoprefixer
- Modernizr
- Normalize
- jQuery
- Fontawesome

Locked and loaded with:
- middleman-blog, if you're into that
- middleman-livereload, because duh
- middleman-syntax, so code will be fun to read
- middleman-deploy, for easy deployment with rsync, Github pages, FTP, and SFTP
- middleman-minify-html, to squish markup
- readingtime, to show how long it takes to read and article

TODO: Make this into a project template
